# Code of Conduct

This project is a community effort to build a friendly, reliable CLI for
discovering and installing AI agent skills. We want every participant to feel
welcome, safe, and able to contribute. This Code of Conduct explains the
behavior we expect and how we handle issues.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- Project spaces such as GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and reviews.
- Community spaces where the project is represented, including social media and
  events.
- One-on-one communications related to the project.

If you are unsure whether a space is covered, assume that it is.

## Expected Behavior

We expect participants to:

- Be kind, respectful, and considerate in language and actions.
- Assume good intent and give constructive, actionable feedback.
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences.
- Be mindful of tone in text-only communication.
- Accept responsibility and apologize when mistakes are made.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination of any kind.
- Demeaning, derogatory, or personal attacks.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it promptly.
You can do this in two ways:

Reports should include as much relevant detail as possible, such as:

- A description of what happened.
- Where and when it happened.
- Links to relevant threads or screenshots.
- Any additional context that may help.

We will keep reports confidential to the extent possible and only share
information with those who need it to resolve the issue.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking
appropriate, fair corrective action. They may remove, edit, or reject
contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

### Enforcement Guidelines

The following guidelines describe how we may respond to conduct violations:

1. **Correction**: A private or public note to explain the issue and the
   expected behavior going forward.
2. **Warning**: A formal warning that continued behavior will result in further
   action.
3. **Temporary Ban**: A temporary ban from participation in project spaces.
4. **Permanent Ban**: A permanent ban from the project community.

Actions will be proportional to the severity and context of the violation.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, you may contact the
maintainer via the @beratcmn GitHub profile with an appeal. Please include any
supporting context.
